# File Handling in Python: Count Lines Not Starting with 'T'

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim:
To write a Python program that counts the number of lines in a text file `story.txt` that do **not** start with the alphabet `'T'`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm:
1. Open the file `story.txt` in **read mode**.
2. Initialize a counter `count` to zero.
3. Iterate through each line of the file:
   - Check if the first character of the line is **not** `'T'`.
   - If the line does not start with `'T'`, increment the `count` by 1.
4. After processing all lines, print the `count` value, which represents the number of lines that do not start with `'T'`.

## ðŸ§¾ Program:

    def count_lines_not_starting_with_T(filename="story.txt"):
        count = 0
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as file:
                for line in file:
                    if not line.strip().startswith('T'):
                        count += 1
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.")
            return -1 
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
            return -1
        return count

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        with open("story.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write("The quick brown fox.\n")
            f.write("A lazy dog.\n")
            f.write("Turtles are slow.\n")
            f.write("This is a test.\n")
            f.write("Another line.\n")

        lines_without_T = count_lines_not_starting_with_T()
        if lines_without_T != -1:
        print(f"Number of lines not starting with 'T': {lines_without_T}")

## Output:

## Result:

Thus, The Python program that counts the number of lines in a text file `story.txt` that do **not** start with the alphabet `'T'` was executed successfully.
