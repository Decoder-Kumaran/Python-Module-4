# (B) Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim:
To write a Python program that merges **two dictionaries** and combines their key-value pairs.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm:
1. Define two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` with some key-value pairs.
2. Define a function `merge()` that merges the two dictionaries using the `**` unpacking operator.
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from `dict2` will overwrite that from `dict1`.
3. Call the `merge()` function and print the merged dictionary.

## ðŸ§¾ Program:

    def merge(dict1,dict2):
        merged_dict = {**dict1 , **dict2}
        print(merged_dict)
    dict1 = eval(input("Dictionary-1 : "))
    dict2 = eval(input("Dictionary-2 : "))
    merge(dict1,dict2)

## Result:

Thus, The Python program that merges **two dictionaries** and combines their key-value pairs was executed sucessfully.
