# PYTHON MODULE - 4
# (A) Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim:
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm:
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## ðŸ§¾ Program:

    class cse:
        def mech(self,radius):
            self.radius = radius
            self.area = 3.14*self.radius*self.radius
            print(f"Area of the circle is {self.area:.2f}")
    radius = int(input("Enter the radius of th circle :"))
    area_circle = cse()
    area_circle.mech(radius)

## Output:

## Result:

Thus, The Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user was executed successfully.
